## What is Clover CMS

Clover CMS is a bespoke Content Management System built in PHP on top of Bootstrap. It is the result of several iterations of a custom CMS that I have created during my current employment due to the requirement to avoid commercial CMSs such as Wordpress. 

I have been developing this CMS throughout it's three previous iterations for three years before reaching it's current form in 2022, where it has remained in continuous development.

This CMS has been built for my own personal needs and a modified version has been created to suit the needs of my current employment. As such you may not find this CMS to be very intuitive to work with and develop further. That being said, I want to offer it freely to anyone whos needs it may support as it is a project that I have put a lot of time into and am proud of. I will be happy to assist anyone opting to use it through [Github Issues](https://github.com/Edward144/Clover-CMS/issues).

Clover CMS should be run with PHP 7.1 as a minimum and ideally PHP 7.4. Through my testing it is also compatible with PHP 8.0.
